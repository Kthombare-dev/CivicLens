# Logo Setup Instructions

To use the CivicLens logo in the navigation bar:

1. Save your CivicLens logo image as `civiclens-logo.png`
2. Place it in the `public` folder: `CivicLens/frontend/public/civiclens-logo.png`
3. The logo will automatically appear in the MainNavbar component

The logo should be:
- Square or near-square aspect ratio recommended
- PNG format with transparency preferred
- Recommended size: 40x40px to 80x80px (will be scaled to 40x40px)

If the logo file is not found, the navigation bar will still work but without the logo image.
